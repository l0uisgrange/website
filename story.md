# Digital Tribes: The Universal Language of Online Hostility

*What do political flame wars and sports rivalries have in common? More than you'd think.*

---

Picture two Reddit users. The first is deep in a political thread, furiously typing about the 2016 election. The second is in a sports subreddit, raging about last night's Super Bowl upset. Different topics. Different communities. Different stakes.

But here's what we discovered: **they're using the exact same words to express their anger.**

We analyzed 67,742 cross-community posts on Reddit spanning three years—from heated political debates to intense sports rivalries. Our goal was simple: understand how online "tribes" interact with each other. What we found surprised us.

When Redditors from r/the_donald ventured into r/politics, they used the same emotional vocabulary as fans from r/patriots invading r/falcons. The anger words. The swearing. The cognitive processing patterns. All of it—nearly identical.

**The correlation? r = 0.937.**

That's not a typo. Whether you're fighting about Trump or Tom Brady, anger sounds the same.

Politics is nastier overall—about 3x more hostile than sports discussions. But when hostility happens, it follows a universal linguistic fingerprint. The tribal instinct doesn't care what jersey you're wearing.

In this story, we'll take you through the tribal landscape of Reddit, reveal the surprising patterns hidden in the data, and show you what happens when major events—elections, Super Bowls, Brexit—stress-test these communities.

The language of conflict, it turns out, is universal.
